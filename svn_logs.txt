	svn_repoman.php
		- Listing of repo members will now also link to their SMF accounts (if they exist)
		- Changed all $context['user']['name'] to $context['user']['username'] since it's 
			technically possible for SMF users to change their display name.
		- Added smf_svn_members table to SQL and added interfaces to it. 
		- Added routines to sync user credentials across all repositories

	svn_repoman.php
		- Implemented Add User admin controls
		- Added automated private message when a user is added to a repo
		- Fixed bug in GetSVNAccountPassword() 
		- Added ForceSVNAccountCreation() to create an account with a random password when a
			forum member is added to a repo, who does not currently have an SVN account. 
		- Added a check to make sure repos exist before adding users
		- Added some better error handling to various functions
		
110306
	svn_repoman.php
		- Removed references to WebSVN authentication. WebSVN now relies on SMF's user auth
			instead of its own htpasswd/htaccess.
		- Read only repo access is now available to those who haven't set up an SVN account
			(but still requires SMF auth)
	websvn-include-config.php
		- Added SMF authentication check, using SSI.php and redirecting to login if not auth'd

	- Started converting things to SMF plugin format
	- Added package-info.xml, modification.xml, SVNRepoManager.php

		as its entry point

	SVNRepoManager.template.php
		- Moved $_REQUEST handlers to inside template_main() 
		- Replaced global constants with SMF's $modSettings
		- Phased out a few globals and replaced with SMF's variables
		- Fixed $_REQUEST['action'] collision with SMF's own inbound action request
		- Reformatted repos.ini and repaired all the post-parse_ini_file() foreach calls.
	SVNRepoManager.php
		- Added SMF guest check, in case they try accessing the manager as a direct action
	modification.xml
		- Added admin interface to set mod settings (paths and such that were previously constants)
			NOTE: $sourcedir/ManageSettings.php operations may not be inserting properly. Double check it!
	websvn-include-config.php
		- Reformatted repos.ini and repaired all the post-parse_ini_file() foreach calls.
